# When playing games where you have to roll two dice, it is nice
# to know the odds of each roll. For instance, the odds of rolling
# a 12 are about 3%, and the odds of rolling a 7 are about 17%.
# You can compute these mathematically, but if you donâ€™t know the
# math, you can write a program to do it. To do this, your program
# should simulate rolling two dice about 10,000 times and compute
# and print out the percentage of rolls that come out to be 2, 3,
# 4, . . . , 12.
