'''
When I was a kid...
...you should make up a story and leave out some words of the story. 
Your program should ask the user to enter some words and tell 
them what types of words to enter. Then print the full story 
along with the inserted words.
'''
cla = input("Enter a class: ")
adj = input("Enter adjective: ")
act = input("Enter activity: ")
print(f'{cla} class was really {adj} today. We learned how to {act} today in class. I can\'t wait for tomorrow\'s class!')
